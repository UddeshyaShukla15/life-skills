# Tiny Habits + Atomic Habits (Quick Reflection)

---

### Question 1: Most interesting story/idea
The most interesting idea was that even extremely small habits (like 1 push-up or flossing 1 tooth) can build real long-term change because they remove the need for high motivation.

---

### Question 2: What is B = MAP?
**B = MAP** means **Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt happen together.**

- **M = Motivation**
- **A = Ability**
- **P = Prompt**

This helps because instead of depending on motivation, we can make habits easier by increasing ability (reducing effort) and using good prompts.

### Question 3: Why is "Shine" / Celebrate important?
Celebration is important because it gives the brain an emotional reward, and that feeling helps lock the habit into your system faster.  
Basically, **what you celebrate becomes automatic.**

---

### Question 4: Most interesting story/idea
The best idea was how small improvements compound over time — getting 1% better daily looks small now, but it becomes a huge difference after weeks and months.

---

### Question 5: Book’s perspective about Identity
Atomic Habits says habits are not just about results, they are about identity — every habit is a vote for the type of person you want to become.

---

### Question 6: How to make a habit easier to do?
The book says to make habits easier by reducing friction: make the habit obvious, simple, and easy to start, so you don’t need motivation to do it.

---

### Question 7: How to make a habit harder to do?
To break a habit, make it harder by increasing friction: remove cues, add obstacles, and reduce rewards so the habit becomes annoying and less automatic.

---

### Question 8: One habit I want to do more of  
**Habit: Eating more food (and eating properly daily)**  

Steps to improve it:  
- Keep food/snacks visible and ready (make the cue obvious)  
- Make it easy by meal prepping or keeping quick options like bananas, nuts, eggs, milk, and bread (make it easy)  
- Make it attractive by eating calorie-dense food that I actually enjoy (make it attractive)  
- Track meals like a streak or reward myself after finishing meals (make it satisfying)  


---

### Question 9: One habit I want to eliminate or reduce
**Habit: Late-night phone scrolling**

Steps to reduce it:
- Keep the phone away from the bed (cue invisible)
- Turn off notifications (less tempting)
- Add friction like app blockers (harder)
- Replace it with a book or music so scrolling feels pointless (unsatisfying)
